# Critical Path Anchor — Liquor Permit Dependency Model

The liquor permit functioned as the program’s critical path anchor.

Revenue activation was impossible without it.

However, the permit was not a single isolated approval.

It required sequential validation across multiple municipal departments.

## Cascading Dependency Chain

Liquor permit approval required:

1. Construction completion
2. Building inspection sign-off
3. Fire inspection clearance
4. Departmental compliance verification
5. City licensing validation
6. Final permit issuance

Failure or delay at any upstream stage reset approval cadence.

The liquor permit was therefore dependent on both physical readiness and regulatory sequencing.

## Critical Path Characteristics

- All downstream streams were gated behind permit issuance.
- Hiring could not activate.
- Inventory could not be purchased.
- Operational ramp could not begin.
- Revenue could not start.

The permit was not a task.

It was the gate controlling program transition from capital burn to revenue generation.

## Disruption Impact

Construction was complete by Month 3.

Permit clearance extended to Month 8.

This created a structural delay in the program’s transition point.

Because the permit was positioned at the end of a cascading approval chain, delay propagated through the entire program timeline.

## Strategic Insight

In capital-sensitive programs, the critical path is not merely the longest sequence of tasks.

It is the dependency chain that controls revenue activation.

For this project, that chain culminated in liquor permit approval.

All activation gating logic was anchored to this milestone.
