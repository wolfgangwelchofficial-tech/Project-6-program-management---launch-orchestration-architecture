# Workstream Layering & Phased Execution Model

The remodel and launch program was executed through structured workstream layering.

Streams were not activated simultaneously.

They were staged based on dependency and capital exposure.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundational Infrastructure

These streams were activated immediately:

- Construction / Remodel
- Licensing & Regulatory
- Vendor Contracts
- Financial Management

These streams formed the structural base of the program.

Construction and regulatory sequencing directly influenced the critical path.

Financial management ensured liquidity tracking throughout the process.

---

## Phase 2 — Systems & Brand Activation

Activated once structural progress allowed:

- Vendor Contracts (continued coordination)
- Technology Implementation (POS, Inventory, Scheduling, Payroll)
- Marketing & Brand Development
- Compliance & Insurance

These streams prepared the operating system before revenue began.

Activation was intentionally staged to prevent premature burn.

---

## Phase 3 — Operational Activation

Intentionally gated behind liquor permit approval:

- Hiring & Training
- Inventory Acquisition
- Staff Onboarding
- Final Systems Testing

This phase was compressed into a 30-day sprint upon regulatory clearance.

---

## Sequencing Logic

The layering model ensured:

- Capital preservation under delay
- Prevention of downstream burn before approval
- Structural readiness prior to activation
- Rapid operational mobilization once clearance was granted

Workstreams were managed through a Gantt-based dependency timeline with activation gates tied to regulatory milestones.
