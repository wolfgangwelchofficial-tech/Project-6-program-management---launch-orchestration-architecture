# Dependency Mapping Overview

The program was structured around a cascading dependency chain.

---

## Upstream Dependencies

Construction → Inspections → Department Sign-offs

---

## Critical Path

Department Sign-offs → Liquor Permit Issuance

---

## Downstream Activation Dependencies

Liquor Permit → Hiring → Inventory → Training → Opening

---

## Program Logic

The liquor permit was the central gating node.

All downstream operational activation depended on its issuance.

Upstream construction and compliance tasks fed into its approval.

This formed a single dominant dependency chain controlling revenue activation.
